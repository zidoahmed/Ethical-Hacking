## Introduction to Cybersecurity
- **Cybersecurity**:- a very wide field in the IT world
    - It is *the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks*.
    - These cyber-attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users via ransomware; or interrupting normal business processes.
    - Those Cyber Attacks are called "Hacking".  
## What is Hacking?
- Hacking is referred to exploiting *vulnerabilities* and compromising security controls gain unauthorized access to the system. 
- Ethical Hacking finds the weak points or loopholes in a computer, web application or network and reports them to the organization.
- The person who perform hacking is called **Hacker**
# Types of Hackers
## Based on ethics:
**1. Black hat hackers**
- The most evil and bad people in the cyberspace.
- They hack people and organizations without their consent.
- They mostly aim for harming organizations, companies, corporations and many more for a political or any other kind of cause.
**2. White hat hackers**
- They are helping and good people.
- Also known as "Ethical Hackers"
- They hack people and organizations with consent.
- They search, find and report vulnerabilities to their clients and even often offering solutions for their vulnerabilities.
**3. Grey hat hackers**
- Individuals who sometimes act ethically and other times engage in questionable or illegal activities.
## Based on skill:
**1. Newbie/Noob**
- They don't any knowledge about hacking.
**2. Script Kiddie**
- A script kiddie, skiddie, kiddie or skid is a relatively unskilled individual who uses scripts or programs developed by others, primarily for malicious purposes.
- They have better knowledge than Newbies/Noobs.
- They skip the necessary steps to become a hacker like computer basics, Linux/Unix Systems, Networking concepts, programming, etc. and then jump straight into hacking by watch YT tutorials.
**3. Hacker**
- Perfectly skilled, with less experience.
**4. Elite/Pro Hacker**
- Perfectly skilled, with much more experience
# Why do we learn cybersecurity?
1. To prevent hackers from gaining access
2. To uncover vulnerabilities
3. To strengthen the organization
4. To safeguard the data
5. To avoid security breaches
6. To enhance security awareness
7. The industry needs cybersecurity experts.
### Who can be an ethical hacker??
1. Knowledge of Technology/Security areas
2. Ability to learn
3. Inquisitive mindset
4. Strong work ethics
5. Forensic and security people.
### Why hack happens?
- ATTACKS = MOTIVE(GOAL) + METHOD + VULNERABILITY
- MOTIVE:- Information theft, manipulating data, financial loss, revenge, ransom, damaging reputation.
### Elements of Cybersecurity
**CIA Triad**
- The three letters in CIA triad stand for *Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability*.
- The CIA triad is a common model that forms the basis for the development of security systems.
- If any of these three is unfulfilled, then the probability of getting hacked by someone or some group is high. These triads must exist at the same time in order for the data to be secure.
- All security measures are based on one or more of these three principles.
	- Confidentiality (Mistrawinet):- 
		- involves the efforts of an organization to make sure data is kept secret or private. Maybe by the means of encryption or any other methods.
		- Example:- Facebook Data breach exposing user info. 
	- Integrity (tamagninet):- 
		- The integrity of your data is maintained only if the data is authentic, accurate and reliable.
		- Example:- 
			- Attack on financial transactions to alter records
			- Attack on different historical records of a company altering the actual records and changing them to the hacker's liking.
	- Availability (tegegninet):- 
		- means information resources (e.g., computer hardware, software, networks and data) are accessible when you need them
		- Even if the date is kept confidential and its integrity maintained, it is often useless it is available to those in the organization and the customers they serve.
		- Example:- 
			- There is power outage and there is no disaster recovery system in place to help users regain access to critical systems, availability will be compromised.
			- Cyber attacks on a government website causing downtime.
### Skills to become a hacker
- Computer Programming:- helps us understand what is happening under the hood. For this course, we will learn about **python** for this section. You can add also other programming languages like **C++, C, JS** and others
- Computer Networking:- Helps us understand how computers work in the internet. How stuff are transferred or sent through the internet.
- Systems Understanding:- Understanding the systems help us to know how to exploit the systems based on the OS.
	- *Linux*
	- *Windows*
- The hard part about hacking/cybersec, is that to hack some kind of system you need to know what that system is built with. 
- For example:-
	- If you're going to hack a website, you need at least know the basics of what's used to build that website. If it's built using node js, you at least need to know something about node js. If it is built using php, the same procedure.  
### Phases of hacking
1. **Reconnaissance**:- Gathering info about the target through passive and active means. (e.g. scanning, OSINT).
2. **Scanning**:- Identifying open ports, services and vulnerabilities using hacking tools.
3. **Gaining Access**:- Exploiting vulnerabilities to access the target system.
4. **Maintaining Access**:- Establishing back doors or persistence for continuous access.
5. **Covering tracks**:- Erasing logs and hiding any signs of intrusion.
### Penetration Testing
- Penetrations testing is a method of evaluating the security of an information system or network by simulating an attack to:
	- Find vulnerability
	- Security measures
	- Documentation and report preparation.
### Why we need Pen Testing?
- Identification of threats
- Security protections and controls
- Assessment of organization's security
- Evaluation of network security
- Upgradation of infrastructure.
### Types of Pen Testing
1. Black Box Pentesting:- 
	- Testing systems without prior knowledge. 
	- **You test as an attacker.**
	- You don't the output of your hack.
2. White Box Pentesting:-
	- Testing systems with prior knowledge of the system
	- **You test as a Developer**
	- You know the output of your hack with details
3. Grey Box Pentesting:- 
	- Testing system with limited knowledge of system
	- **You test as a user**
	- it is basically mix of both White Box and Black Box. i.e. WBPT + BBPT = GBPT
	- You might or might not know the output of your hack.
### Cybersec field terms
- **Red Teaming/*Offensive security*/**: 
	- Red Teaming involves simulating real-world attacks to test an organization's security posture. Pentesting can included in this field.
	- This field mainly include **ATTACKERS**
- **Blue Teaming /*Defensive security*/**: 
	- Blue teaming refers to defending against attacks and improving security controls. 
	- The "Blue Team" monitor systems, analyze network traffic, and responds to potential threats.
	- This field mainly include **DEFENDERS**
- **Security Audit**: 
	- A security audit is a comprehensive evaluation of an organization's information systems, security controls, and procedures.
	- It assesses ==compliance== with security standards, policies, and regulatory requirements.
- **Vulnerability Assessment**:
	- A vulnerability assessment identifies and classifies security flaws in systems, networks, and software.
	- It involves automated scanning, manual testing and analysis to highlight weaknesses.
