#### 4. Most secure
- It is an open-source operating system which makes it more customizable, and compared to Mac and Windows they can watch what we are doing But, when it comes to Linux, because it's open-source nobody can access what people other than him are doing.
- ==BEING OPEN SOURCE MAKES LINUX VERY SAFE!==
### Linux distributions/distros
- Distro is a modified Linux kernel, 
- People with the knowledge of C programming language can modify this kernel to their liking.
- Type of operating systems with different:
	1. **Linux kernel**
	2. **Packages (GNU)**
	3. **Package manager**
	4. **Desktop User Interface** aka **Desktop environment.**
- So many distros, including:
	- Debian:- Kali Linux, Ubuntu (different from other distros, more of a general-purpose operating system.), Parrot OS,...
	- Arch:- Black Arch, Garuda, .....
	- Fedora
	- Red Hat
	- Gentoo
	- Android
- *All these OS are just modified from one another because of people not liking some features of the Linux distros. But the main one thing that all these distros have in common is that they're all based on GNU/Linux OS.*
- You use one of these distros based on your skill level. If you're a beginner, it is recommended for you to use Ubuntu or Pop OS and then eventually change your distro as you like but if you don't want to change it, it's up to you.
### Lets some of these distros:

| Distro     | Based on   | Purpose                                                         | Desktop UI | Package Manager | Shell |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ----- |
| Kali Linux | Debian     | Digital Forensics and Pentesting (funded by offensive security) | xfce       | apt             | zsh   |
| Parrot OS  | Debian     | Both for developers and hackers (different version for both)    | mate       | apt             | bash  |
| Ubuntu     | Debian     | General-purpose                                                 | gnome      | apt             | bash  |
| Garuda     | Arch Linux | Mainly for hackers (security)                                   | KDE Plasma | pacman          | fish  |

- What we learn from this is, *Debian-based* distros have their package manager set to *apt* and the  *arch-based* distros use *pacman* as their main package manager.
- It better to start with these distros as a beginner especially Kali Linux, Parrot OS, Ubuntu or even Pop OS. Garuda is more advanced or intermediate level.
#### Do windows have distros like Linux?
- Windows doesn't have any kind of distros because the source code isn't open-source, so won't be able to edit and create different distros for windows like Linux.
- It just gives updates and adds some features on it.
### Installation methods
- The main thing about these installation methods is just to get access to a terminal which is the main instrument we need in order to perform hacking.

| Installation method   | Procedure                                                                                                                                                    | Advantages                                                    | Disadvantages                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Main Os/ Main-boot | Kali Linux is installed as the sole operating system in your machine                                                                                         | Performance, security and simplicity                          | No Access to other OS, Data loss risk                        |
| 2. Dual Boot (2 in 1) | Kali Linux is installed alongside another OS (usually windows or another Linux distro)                                                                       | Access to Multiple OS and Data presentation                   | Complexity and no resource sharing between Operating Systems |
| 3. Live boot          | refers to running an operating system from a removable media. (Like USB Drive or any other)                                                                  | Privacy and No risk of data loss                              | Resource sharing                                             |
| 4. Cloud terminals    | This procedure is recommended for really low performance laptops, which is basically using it on the web on any web browser you want. Using www.webminal.org | Useful for people with devices that have very low performance | you can only use the terminal                                |
| 5. Virtual Machine    | This is the most popular way used by hackers to use multiple operating systems.                                                                              | The ability of using more than 2 OS on a single machine       | It may affect the performance of your device                 |
|                       |                                                                                                                                                              |                                                               |                                                              |
- Computers have a technology called "virtualization". This is the method how it allocate our memory to the VMs.
- There is 2 types of virtualization:
	### 1. Type 1 Virtualization (Bare-Metal Hypervisor):- 
	- Runs directly on the physical hardware.
	- does not require a host operating system.
	- Examples:- VMware ESXi, Proxmox, Xen.
	- Advantages:- 
		- Higher performance and efficiency
		- Better resource management and isolation
		- Commonly used in enterprise environments for server virtualization.
	### 2. Type 2 Virtualization:-
	- Requires a host operating system.
	- Basically the opposite of the type 1 virtualization.
